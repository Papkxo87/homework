        <p class="text">It doesn't matter what you do, because in order to do it well, you should delve into the origins of the lesson, familiarize yourself with its background and find out how it all began. 
            Site building is no exception, especially since the first sites appeared not so long ago and you just need to dig a little to find out by whom and when the very first site in the world was developed. 
            First, it is worth understanding what exactly is meant by the word "site". Today, the site - denotes a specific place in the World Wide Web and this place is not limited either by size or quantity. 
            We do not even think about how many sites exist all over the world and from what stages site building began, and in order to open this dark veil for you, we decided to write this informative article. 
            Before the opportunity to create sites appeared, the Internet appeared and this event took place in 1990 year. The Internet without information was a completely useless invention and needed to be filled. 
            It was this question that the British scientist Timothy Berners-Lee, who created his developments at the European Laboratory of Elementary Particles, decided to tackle. Before creating the site, 
            he managed to prepare other equally important tools that underlie many programs today. It was he who created the Internet, successfully developed the URL, as well as the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP" target="blank" >HTTP</a>  protocol, and prescribed the 
            programming language that we now know as <a href ="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="blank">HTML</a> . Developing the Internet, the scientist believed that he was creating it precisely in order to simplify the process of storing and collecting information, 
            so that for any question the answer could be found quickly and easily. Given the trend of everyday use of the Internet today, we can safely say that the scientist's ideas have fully justified themselves in practice.</p>

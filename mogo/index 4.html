              that provides access to related documents located on various computers connected to the Internet. 
              The world wide web is made up of millions of web servers. Most of the world wide web resources are hypertext. 
              Hypertext documents placed on the world wide web are called web pages. Multiple web pages that share a common theme, 
              design, and links, and are usually located on the same web server, are called a web site. Special browser programs are 
              used to download and view web pages. The world wide web has caused a real revolution in information technology and a 
              boom in the development of the Internet. Often, when talking about the Internet, they mean the world wide web, but it 
              is important to understand that this is not the same thing. The word web and "WWW"are also used to refer to the world wide web. </p>
